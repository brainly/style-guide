Utilities are single purpose flexible classes based on design system variables. They are meant to provide building blocks for custom designs in application and styleguide without writing additional CSS. Because of the nature of utility classes they are also good choice to override other styles in places where additional tweaking is needed.

## Responsive design

Utility classes can provide responsive versions available by prefix the utility with the breakpoint name using following formula:

<pre>
  <code>[breakpoint]:sg-[utility-class]</code>
</pre>

## Pseudo variants

Utility classes can be also applied or changed per pseudo class versions available by prefix the utility with the pseudo variant name using following formula:

<pre>
  <code>[pseudo]:sg-[utility-class]</code>
</pre>

## Mix variants

Responsive design prefix work with pseudo variants using the following formula:

<pre>
  <code>[breakpoint]:[pseudo]:sg-[utility-class]</code>
</pre>
