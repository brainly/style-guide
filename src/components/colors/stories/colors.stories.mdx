# Colors

All of our colors are designed to create a clear interface, support the hierarchy of information on the page and bring attention to the most important elements. Both the core and additional colors are built with base and supporting colors – dark and light.

Base colors should be applied most frequently across our UI elements whereas supporting colors are recommended to use as the colors for surfaces, backgrounds (light tones) and typography (dark tones).

## Core colors

Our primary color palette consists of black, white, gray, blue, green, purple, red, yellow and their variants. These colors represent our visual brand identity.

<ColorPalette>
  {color.core.map(({ name, variable, hex }) => (
    <ColorItem
      key={name}
      title={name}
      subtitle={variable}
      colors={[`#${hex}`]}
    />
  ))}
</ColorPalette>
