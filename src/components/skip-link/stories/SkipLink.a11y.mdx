### Rules

SkipLink is one way to [pass Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks)

A keyboard-functional "skip" link **SHOULD** be provided to allow keyboard users to navigate directly to the main content.
The main content of a web page rarely comes first in a typical layout. Before users can arrive at the main content, they must skip past features like the website's logo, navigation and branding.

#### SkipLink

| Pattern                                                                                        | Comment | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Should** have been provided to allow keyboard users to navigate directly to the main content |         |        |
| **Should** be the first focusable element on the page.                                         |         |        |
| **Must** be either visible at all times or visible on keyboard focus.                          |         |

#### Usage

```jsx
<>
<SkipLink id="#main-content">Skip to main content</SkipLink>

<!-- the header, navigation, etc. go here -->

{/*  tabindex value of -1 keeps the element out of the natural tab order
 but prevents focus from jump back up to the next link after the "skip navigation" link on Safari */}
<main id="mainContent" tabindex="-1">
    <!-- the main content goes here -->
</main>
</>
```
