SkipLink is one way to [pass Success Criterion 2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/bypass-blocks)

A keyboard-functional "skip" link **SHOULD** be provided to allow keyboard users to navigate directly to the main content.
The main content of a web page rarely comes first in a typical layout. Before users can arrive at the main content, they must skip past features like the website's logo, navigation and branding.

### Rules

#### SkipLink

<AccessibilityList rules={rules} />

#### Usage

```jsx
<body>
    <SkipLink id="#main-content">Skip to main content</SkipLink>

    <!-- the header, navigation, etc. go here -->

    <main id="mainContent" tabindex="-1">
        <!-- the main content goes here -->
    </main>
</body>
```

<InfoBox>
  <code>tabindex="-1"</code> added to the main content keeps the element out of
  the natural tab order but prevents focus from jump back up to the next link
  after the "skip navigation" link on Safari.
</InfoBox>
