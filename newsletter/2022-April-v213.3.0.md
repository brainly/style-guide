## Storybook deployment and preview on a PR 🚀

We have added Storybook deployment for each pull request!

You can verify, if your recent changes on the branch were deployed, by checking status of GitHub check. You can preview your changes to the StyleGuide, by clicking on the `Details` link.

![storybook preview github check](./assets/2022-april/storybook-preview-gh-check.png)

The url is constructed out of the branch name:

```
https://style-guide.brainly.com/branch/<YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>/
```

so, for branch called `new-subject-icons` the Storybook preview will be build under:

```
https://style-guide.brainly.com/branch/new-subject-icons/
```

## MDX documentation 📖

We are gradually switching over to MDX documentation in the Storybook.
MDX gives us full control compared to Storybook’s auto-generated documentation. It allows us to customize docs with our own components and to keep both documentation and stories in a single file. Because we can include other MDX files within a MDX file, you can now see accessibility section in documentation of some components in Storybook!

This is an ongoing process aimed to be achieved in this quarter (Q2 2022).

List of converted components stories:

`Accordion, Avatar, Breadcrumbs, Box, Bubble, Buttons, Card, Counter, Dialog, Dropdowns, FileHandler, FlashMessage, Flex, Footer, Header, HomeButton, Icon, Label, Layout, List, Logo`

## Box responsive props 💻

- Added responsive props support to the Box component for the following props:

  - border
  - noBorderRadius
  - padding
  - shadow

## Responsive props documentation 💻

Responsive props makes easy to declaratively set prop value for multiple screen sizes. [Documentation page](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/foundation-%E2%9C%A8-responsive-props--page) was added to Foundation:

Missing responsive props documentation was added for the following components:

- [Subheadline](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-subheadline--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Headline](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-headline--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Text](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-text--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Flex](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-flex--default-story#responsive-props)

## New subject icons ✨

All of the subject icons (including mono subject icons) were redesigned, as a follow up of our rebranding that has started last year.

You can see some of the icon files are duplicated, because some icons file names were changed and we didn't want to introduce breaking changes to the application and various markets at that stage.

You can find a list of all icons [here](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/story/components-subjecticon--types).

## New notification favicons 🔔

New notification favicons were added. Because the notification indicator overflows the logotype, all favicons had to be adjusted to account for that space.

Examples of new notifications favicons for each market:
