## üñä StyleGuide Live Editor (beta version)

We've created a [live editor inside the storybook](https://styleguide.brainly.com/docs/?path=/story/tools-live-editor--live-editor), so you don't have to run StyleGuide on your local environment to be able to test out StyleGuide components! This tool is in beta version and is to be improved in the future.

## üì∞ Newsletter in storybook

You can now access our newsletter editions in the storybook. These pages are dynamically created upon the build process, so we have one source of truth for our newsletter, that can be easily accessed in github, but at the same time exist in the storybook!

## üëÜ Focus style

We've added two types of focus - default one, called `focusStyle` and one used for inline, wrapped elements called `focusTextStyle`.

Components using `focusStyle`: `Accordion`, `Avatar`, `Button`, `Dialog`, `FileHandler`, `HomeButton`, `IconAsButton`, `Label`, `Rating`, `Search`, `SkipLink`, native interactive elements besides `<a>`.

    width="200px"
  />
</p>

Components using `focusTextStyle`: `Link`, `Dropdown`, native `<a>`.

    width="300px"
  />
</p>

There are also new mixins available:

- `applyFocusStyle` & `applyFocusTextStyle` - only with focus style
- `applyFocus` & `applyFocusText` - with rules when focus should be visible

Focus colors can be changed by overwriting following css variables: `--focusColorOuter`, `--focusColor`, `--focusColorInner`.

## üñº Dialog for ads

We have reworked Dialog layout so it holds slots for ads.
