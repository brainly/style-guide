## Components color API changes

Color API changes caused by introduction of new [color tokens](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/story/foundation-%E2%9C%A8-colors--page).

- Icon
- MobileIcon
- SubjectIcon
- MathSymbol
- IconAsButton
- Text
- TextBit
- Link
- Headline
- Bubble
- Box
- Label
- CardHole
- Spinner, SpinnerContainer
- Counter
- Overlay
- FileHandler
- Media
- Separators

There's only `Button` component API left to be refactored, though the component itself is already consuming new color tokens.

## Caveats

- Package "s3" has been forked to @brainly organization. One of dependencies of this package (graceful-fs) was causing our builds to fail. Since this package is no longer maintained, we decided to fork it and make needed updates. As a long-term solution, we need to switch "s3" package to something more up-to-date.
