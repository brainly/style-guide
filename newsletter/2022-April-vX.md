## Storybook deployment and preview on a PR

We have added Storybook deployment for each pull request!

You can verify, if your recent changes on the branch were deployed, by checking status of GitHub check. You can preview your changes to the StyleGuide, by clicking on the `Details` link.
![storybook preview github check](./assets/2022-april/storybook-preview-gh-check.png)

The url is constructed out of the branch name:

```
https://style-guide.brainly.com/branch/<YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>/
```

so, for branch called `new-subject-icons` the Storybook preview will be build under:

```
https://style-guide.brainly.com/branch/new-subject-icons/
```

## MDX documentation

We are gradually switching over to MDX documentation in the Storybook.
MDX gives us full control compared to Storybookâ€™s auto-generated documentation. It allows us to customize docs with our own components and to keep both documentation and stories in a single file.

This is an ongoing process aimed to be achieved in this quarter (Q2 2022).

Example of a new documentation page:

- [Subheadline](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-subheadline--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Headline](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-headline--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Text](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-text--default-story#responsive-props)
- [Flex](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/docs/components-flex--default-story#responsive-props)

## New subject icons

All of the subject icons (including mono subject icons) were redesigned, as a follow up of our rebranding that has started last year.

You can see some of the icon files are duplicated, because some icons file names were changed and we didn't want to introduce breaking changes to the application and various markets at that stage.

You can find a list of all icons [here](https://style-guide.brainly.com/?path=/story/components-subjecticon--types).

![new subject icons mono](./assets/2022-april/subject-icons-mono.png)

## New notification favicons

New notification favicons were added. Because the notification indicator overflows the logotype, all favicons had to be adjusted to account for that space.

Examples of new notifications favicons for each market:

## Dialog component changes

There were a lot of improvements made to the Dialog component since its release:

- Added `data-testid` prop for both Dialog and DialogCloseButton components, for testing purposes.
- Adjusted fullscreen Dialog animation - increased transition distance and duration, so it is more visible to the users that the Dialog actually appears over the page.
- Prevent Dialog scrollbars from showing up during show transition - issue with Dialog scrollbars that were causing unexpected shift during show animation was fixed.
- Fixed unimplemented transitionEnd event - firing `onEntryTransitionEnd` and `onExitTransitionEnd` callbacks was fixed for environments, that don't support transition events, e.g. the JSDOM and some older browsers.
- Fixed removing Dialog no-scroll class - no-scroll body class is now removed before `onExitTransitionEnd` callback is fired.

## Box component changes

- Added responsive props support to the Box component for the following props:

  - border
  - noBorderRadius
  - padding
  - shadow
